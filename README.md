# Cache access speed
In this tiny experiment we demonstrate the access speed difference between CPU's L1 cache and main memory. Retrieving a value from CPU's cache takes on average around 26 CPU clock cycles, whereas reading from main memory around 170 CPU clock cycles. These values vary between different CPUs.
